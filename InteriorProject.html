                We were very happy with your designer!
                
                - Good communication
                - Great time management, with planned reviews, written and virtual check-ins
                - Managed to blend our two very different styles together and came up with a beautiful design
                - Worked within our budget and produced super practical designs.
                
                Kind Regards</p>

                Amy designed for me a beautiful, modern, stylish new kitchen in my flat and also helped to find perfect pieces for other rooms that I’d been struggling to find. She was really fun to work with, her enthusiasm shines through always and everything was presented professionally and beautifully. Everything was really collaborative and the resulting design works really well in the space. Really happy to have worked with Amy.</p>

            <p>Your designers did a fantastic job - not only is the design beautiful and 100% suited to our lifestyle, the delivery was seamless and to the highest standards. They made the whole process feel easy from start to finish. Their design recommendations were always spot on, yet they were very open to our ideas and always acted on our input. The project coordination with the contractor they recommended really exceeded our expectations - delivery was timely and high quality, and everything was happening in the right sequence and at pace.</p>
